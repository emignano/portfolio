            <p class="header">Hello!</p>
            <p>And welcome! Thanks for stumbling upon my portfolio!</p>
            <p>I’m Enzo, a current student in the brand new <a target="_blank" href="https://taubmancollege.umich.edu/urban-technology/?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=taubman-utech&utm_term=program&utm_content=responsive-3" class="link hoverAnimation">Urban Technology</a> degree program. My studies are a culmination of understanding cities, design, and code in order to effectively change how the cities of tomorrow operate. Through my curriculum, I have become proficient in design fundamentals, design processes, data analysis, user/interaction experience, and user interface design. I am also studying <a target="_blank" href="https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs" class="link hoverAnimation">Complex Systems</a> where I model and analyze disparate systems and networks to observe how they function and interact with each other.</p>
            <p>My academic focus has only increased my passion for technology. I am always curious about how the world works and if I can make it <span style="font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;">better</span>. Being comfortable with my skills allows me to test my ideas real time and make iterations to improve the overall quality. My projects are been both a reflection of my course work and personal budding interest projects.</p>
            <p>Until we meet again, thanks for stopping by!</p>

            <p>Happy New Year!</p>
            <p>Got a lot planned for this year, including many personal projects.</p>
            <p>Last semester W23, I created a game manual of a board game called Tech Cluster Ventures. It's hybrid of The Game of Life, Fiasco, and Catan. My goal is to make this a tangiable item.</p>
            <p>Currently trying to learn blender to make the game pieces.</p>

            <p class="caption">Concept of the cards. Very rushed as the project deadline was close and I did not need to make these. Will revist as I do not like the "Fancy" look. I think it should be more cartoony.</p>
