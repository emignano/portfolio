                <p>During the first step of the project, we looked at some example databases and generated HWM questions based on interesting relationships we saw in the data. After making a couple of questions, we had to choose an area to focus on. Our group decided to pursue mobility. Below are the HWM and additional questions that guided our approach.</p>
                <p><b>Final HWM</b>: How might we be able to visualize how New Yorkers move around NYC?</p>

                <p class="header">Choosing The Visual Structure</p>
                <p>Choosing how we wanted to visualize the data was one challenge we faced during the ideation process. The goal was to make an easy to read map where patterns could be uncovered just by glancing at the surface, and then more in detail as the user interacts with the visualization.</p>
                <p>How we wanted to do this went through multiple iterations. Using the Crazy 8's method, we prototyped node networks, bar charts, 3d pillars, and bubble circles. However, we felt these mediums were either too complex where it was deciphering trends, or too basic where further analysis through interactions were hard to incorporate. </p>
                <p>In our final iteration, we decided to use a Choropleth map as our medium. Our data was location based, and while the previous design iterations could represent the data, our focus was on the movement of people around NYC, and a Choropleth map gave the flexibility to show the data on the surface and the ability to incorporate further user interactions.</p>

                <p>Choosing the right colors was also a major consideration. The issue was there were two types of information that needed to be seen: Incoming and Outgoing taxi trips. Our final color palette was chosen for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Colors show the intensity of the data by using cooler colors for low traffic and warmer colors for high traffic. They also humans perceived notion of color definitions</p></li>
                    <li><p>Similar but different for the two types of data to show the relationship but also keeping them separate</p></li>

                <p>The tool tip was the first interaction implemented and was designed to give further analysis on the different districts. Its position on the map was off to the side to not cover any of the information, and was locked in the same place to limit eye movement. In addition, the top three districts are only shown to keep the tooltip concise.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Clicking: Changed information between incoming and outgoing traffic. It also changed the color palette the represent the right information</p></li>
