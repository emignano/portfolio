User testing was a crucial part of the iteration process because we wanted to make sure that users could understand the tools and information presented to them. Making a tool that looks nice is one thing, but designing it to act as an extension to the human decision making process was our intended goal. </p>
                    <p>In order to accomplish this, we tested a variety of design layouts, colors, and navigational sequences. We took note of what worked and what could be improved.</p>
