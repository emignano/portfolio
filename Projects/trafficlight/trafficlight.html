Why a button looks one way or why the electric bus sign is showing this information are all data driven, using both user and object data. The goal of this project was to find and dissect an urban object users come into contact with everyday. Then by using the information collected, figure out its place within the overall urban system structure and how it interacts with other objects. </p>

                    <p>What fascinates me about the urban landscape is how chaotic it is. There are numerous different convoluted networks and systems layered on top of each other just to make a city function. This complexity is often hidden to its citizens, however, and for good reason. A complex city interface would be too stressful for the average user. So when choosing an object, I was reminded of this quote:</p>

                    <p>This quote highlights the fact that chaos and order are not mutually exclusive, but rather, work together to make a lively yet usable space. So when choosing an object, I decided to choose something that tries to organize society while still giving freedom. That's how I landed on traffic lights.</p>
                    <p>Traffic lights dictate our decisions, control our time, and reorganize our priorities as we navigate around the city. The power this object has is all self imposed, in other words, we choose to listen to the lights.</p>
                    <p>One could ignore and break the rules resulting in societal punishments, but even when we have that choice, we still mostly choose to follow it. Using the time to send a text, pick up something that fell, or take a bite of a breakfast burrito before turning into work. This object has so many nuances that I wanted to explore.</p>
                    <p>That’s enough of my rant, on to the project.</p>

                    <p class="">Now that I had an object, I went and gathered observational evidence to begin my unmaking.

                    <p>Traffic lights also interact with the environment itself. Weather conditions can affect the visibility of the lights which can alter our decision response time to them.</p>

                    <p>This project was a fun one for me to complete as it incorporated my main academic interests of data and complex systems. Taking a deep dive into the inner workings of an urban object allowed me to gain a solid foundation of what builds up and sustains a city, from tiny towns to large networked metropolises. </p>
                    <p>For future inquiry, I would love to take a more in depth look at the more uncommon interactions of the traffic light. For example, doing a deep dive of what happens to society if traffic lights are not obeyed. My project was built on the foundation that everyone follows it, but that is not the case. Looking into this more would be my next step to fully understanding the city system in its entirety. </p>
