                <p>Course: UT 103 The Incomplete City</p>
                <p>Professor: <a target="_blank" href="https://tobanshadlyn.com/About" class="link hoverAnimation">Toban Shadlyn</a></p>
                <p>Date: Spring 2022</p>
                <p>Project Type: Group</p>
                <p>Summary: The Incomplete City project was a course designed around learning about disparate urban systems and how they interact with each other. Modeled after the game Cities: Skylines, our cohort was tasked to create a paper city for a randomly generated stakeholder population where we could only use pictures of urban objects our cohort collected during our <a target="_blank" href="https://urbantechnology.substack.com/p/urban-technology-at-university-of-d1b" class="link hoverAnimation">Chicago trip</a>. This project was split into three parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Part One: Create a neighborhood for the assigned stakeholder group</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Part Two: Combine with 1 or 2 more neighborhoods to create districts</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Part Three: Combine all the districts together to create a city</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The main constraint was that all the city systems had to connect to each other across the entire city, meaning if one group had a light rail system, then we had to incorporate it throughout the remaining districts. Below are some pictures of the entire process and end result.</p>
